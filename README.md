# Soft-robot-kitchen-assistant
This is a repository for the code, CAD and assembly information for the 'Soft Robotic Kitchen Assistant for People with a Fine Motor disability' project I completed. 

The project addresses the challenge of food preparation for individuals with fine motor control difficulties or limb amputations by providing a dual-mode (soft and rigid) robotic device. The device uses a PneuNet based 'finger' actuator designed for finer slicing and rigid second system with some compliance. The innovation extends the applications of soft robotics and facilitates independent living for individuals with disabilities and showcasing the synergy between pneumatic rigid and compliant robotics in enhancing daily tasks.
